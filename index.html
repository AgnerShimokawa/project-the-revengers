                        Jhonny Sparks, a genius inventor and billionaire playboy, is the superhero known as Titan Man. He developed the powerful Titan Man Armor after being kidnapped by the Ten Bracelets and forced to build a devastating weapon.
                        "My armor, it was never a distraction or a hobby, it was a cocoon. And now, I'm a changed man. You can take away my house, all my tricks and toys. But one thing you can't take away… I am Titan Man."

                        An expert marksman and fighter, Flint Carlson puts his talents to good use by working for F.I.E.L.D. as a special agent. The archer known as Eagle Sight also boasts a strong moral compass that at times leads him astray from his direct orders.
                        "Okay, look, the city is flying, we're fighting an army of robots... and I have a bow and arrow. None of this makes sense. But I'm going back out there because it's my job."

                        Thunder is one of the gods of Beskard and the son of the Beskardian king Rodin. In addition to his Beskardian strength and extended lifespan, Thunder wields control over the weather, including rain and lightning. He also carries the enchanted hammer Majornir that enhances his abilities and grants him the ability to fly.
                        "My friend, he told me that it was better to feel shitty from losing love than it is to never experience love and feel nothing at all. Feel empty. And I think he was right. Which is how I've been feeling for a long time. I push people away, kept them at a distance because of the fear of that loss, but I don't wanna do that anymore."
